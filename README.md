I started building this midi controller for the AX-80, all 45 controls are presented with buttons and LEDs for the switch functions. Encoders for the 0-99 controls.

It will have 999 patch memories and names and can be used as a master for the AX-80 which means you don't store any sounds on the AX and the editor is in charge. Or normal mode where it just edits parameters.

It also acts as a usb to MIDI converter so you can play the AX over USB from your DAW.

I've also mapped CC 7 for volume to CC 96 (VCA level) to act as a volume control.
